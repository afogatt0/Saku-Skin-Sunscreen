                    <p >All dermatological professionals will emphasize the importance of skin protection and preventing sunburns.
                    You can become sunburned from spending extended periods of time outside with no sunscreen, and also from using tanning
                    beds or booths. If you continuously get sunburns, it can lead to damage that can cause skin cancer, premature wrinkling, 
                    and many other skin issues. If you develop a severe sunburn with blisters, reach out to your local dermatologist for help as 
                    they can assess your burn and suggest products to help with the pain and minimize scarring.  IF caught early enough, oral or
                    topical steroids can prevent some of the damage associated with sunburns.

                <h1 id="read_more_title">Prevent the Signs of Aging</h1>
                    <p>Repeated sun exposure with little to no protection can cause damage to your elastin, collagen and skin cells. Over time,
                    this can lead to premature signs of aging including discoloration, wrinkles, fine lines, and a leathery appearance. Premature 
                    aging, called photoaging, is common in those who spend time in the sun without sunscreen – especially in their 20s and 30s. 
                    Thankfully, these skin issues are preventable with daily sunscreen use.

            <h1 id="read_more_title">Reduce Your Risk of Skin Cancer</h1>
                <p>Using sunscreen each day, even when it is cloudy, is one of the best ways to prevent skin cancer. Statistics show that by age 70,
                one in five Americans will develop skin cancer. You can lower your risk of developing this disease using a minimum of SPF 30 multiple 
                times each day. For even more protection, you can use a higher-level SPF. If you are spending prolonged time outdoors or will be in 
                the water, you should reapply your sunscreen every two hours.

            <h1 id="read_more_title">Prevent Skin Discoloration</h1>
                <p>It can be difficult to live with areas of skin discoloration, especially when they appear later in life. These areas of discoloration
                are often called “sun spots” or “liver spots” and are usually tan to brown in color. They often develop on the face, head, hands, and arms, 
                and can affect both men and women. Applying sunscreen periodically throughout your day can help prevent these spots from appearing on your
                skin.

            <h1 id="read_more_title">Reduce Inflammation</h1>
                <p>	When our skin is exposed to UV rays it can cause painful redness and inflammation. This can be especially challenging for individuals
                with skin issues like psoriasis or rosacea. Wearing sunscreen each day helps to prevent inflammation from harmful rays. If you are prone 
                to redness and have sensitive skin, look for a sunscreen with gentle ingredients such as zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. You should also 
                avoid spray-on sunscreens as these can contain harsh formulas, including alcohol that can dry out the skin. If you have questions regarding
                your skin issues or need help selecting a product, reach out to your local board-certified dermatologist for assistance.
